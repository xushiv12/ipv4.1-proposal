## Abstract

IPv4.1 is a proposed extension of the IPv4 addressing format, which incorporates a human-readable suffix for semantic enrichment. It is designed to embed logical identifiers (such as service, user, or role) directly in the address representation, supporting better readability and potential application-layer routing.

---

## 1. Introduction

IPv4 addresses are traditionally represented in a four-octet decimal format (A.B.C.D). IPv4.1 introduces a fifth semantic suffix, yielding addresses like:

http://ipv1.4:192.168.0.1/

or

192.168.0.1.chat

The intent is to preserve full IPv4 compatibility while enabling human-centric identification and optional service-layer logic without changes to existing IP stacks.

---

## 2. Motivation

Modern applications rely heavily on domain names or metadata to distinguish between roles, services, and types of endpoints. IPv4.1 proposes a direct syntax-level extension to embed such meaning at the address layer.

---

## 3. Syntax Definition

IPv4.1 format:
IPv4.1 := IPv4 + "." + Label

yaml

Where:
- `IPv4` is a standard dotted-quad address
- `Label` is an optional alphanumeric suffix (e.g., `chat`, `xu`, `admin1`)
- Maximum label length: 16 characters
- Example: `10.0.0.8.server`

---

## 4. Use Cases

- Device-specific HTTP access: `http://ipv1.4:10.0.0.5/`
- Local user-to-user chat: `192.168.1.9.gavin`
- LAN-based application routing: `172.16.8.3.db`

---

## 5. Compatibility

IPv4.1 is compatible with:
- DNS-based interpretations (via CNAME or wildcards)
- Application-layer routers or interpreters
- Browser-based redirect proxies

---

## 6. Security Considerations

- Must validate suffix to avoid spoofing (`admin`, `root`)
- Ensure host DNS records are trusted if suffixes trigger redirects
- Do not replace existing security checks (e.g., TLS/ACL)

---

## 7. Implementation Suggestion

- DNS wildcard `*.ipv1-4.example.com` can resolve all suffixes to a redirector
- Redirector parses host/port and forwards requests
- Can be implemented via Flask/Python or C++ lightweight proxy

---

## 8. Conclusion

IPv4.1 is a minimalist yet powerful proposal to extend IP readability and semantic control at the syntax level. It offers benefits for local networks, P2P communication, and future overlay routing.
